## My first Pathfinding algorithm:

### Try it out on:

This is my first ever pathfinding algorithm and is just made for fun.

It has a lot of bugs and you can 100% break it, but it does find the path in
most of the easy to medium challenging mazes that you draw. 

Feel free to browse the code and don't hesitate to open an issue and suggest a change. 

This is based on "if/else if" so it crashes easily!

#### Warning:
The code is NOT pretty!
